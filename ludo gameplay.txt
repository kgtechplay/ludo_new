Ludo – Game
Please see the attached image below to get an idea of the board

Ludo Game Items
•	A Ludo board with four colored starting areas (red, blue, yellow, green).
•	16 tokens, 4 in each color
•	A six-sided dice (digital dice in online Ludo)
•	2–4 players

Game Setup
1.	Each player chooses a color – red, green, blue, or yellow.
2.	Place all 4 tokens in the home area of the chosen color.
3.	The player who rolls the highest number starts first.

Game Play
Players take turns in a clockwise order; highest throw of the die starts.
Each throw, the player decides which piece to move. A piece simply moves in a clockwise direction around the track given by the number thrown. If no piece can legally move according to the number thrown, play passes to the next player.
A throw of 6 gives another turn.
A player must throw a 6 to move a piece from the starting circle onto the first square on the track. The piece moves 6 squares around the circuit beginning with the appropriately coloured start square (and the player then has another turn).
If a piece lands on a piece of a different colour, the piece jumped upon is returned to its starting circle.
If a piece lands upon a piece of the same colour, this forms a block. This block cannot be passed or landed on by any opposing piece.
The board has safe squares (usually marked with a star) – tokens placed here cannot be cut by opponents.
After completing one round, your token enters the home column (center path of your color).
To reach home, you must roll the exact number needed.
